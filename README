kfc

kiss for colors, a terminal-emulator color palette setter written in C.


BACKGROUND
----------

This project was inspired by Dylan Arap's POSIX shell script, okpal [0], which
utilizes 16 ANSI colors to control the color scheme of existing terminal-emulator
windows. This allows one to achieve consistent colors across all terminal 
utilities and applications. This application has similar functionality to okpal 
but is designed with execution speed in mind. There are currently 295 light and 
dark color palettes offered at this time that can be applied and quickly swapped 
out for others.  


COMPATIBILITY
-------------

Compatibility with the following terminator-emulators on KISS Linux have been 
tested and confirmed:

- simple terminal, st [2] 
- alacritty [3]


DEPENDENCIES
------------

Other than a terminal emulator and C compiler (e.g. gcc), the application has 
no other dependencies.


INSTALLATION
------------

Building and installing from source:

    git clone https://github.com/mcpcpc/kfc.git
    cd kfc/
    make
    make install

Installing on KISS Linux:

    kiss b kfc && kiss i kfc


USAGE
-----

kfc [-l|-L|-r|-s palette] [|-v|-p]
-l          List palettes
-L          Set light themes (modifier for -s/-r/-l)
-r          Select a random palette
-s palette  Select a palette
-p          Print current palette
-h          Show this information
-v          Show version information


EXAMPLES
--------

For the following examples, remember to replace PALETTE with your preferred 
color schema name. 

- To see if a specific light color palette is available:

      kfc -lL | grep PALETTE

- To apply the light version of the PALETTE:

      kfc -Ls PALETTE

- To verify that the palette was applied (or see the last palette that was
  applied):

      kfc -p

- To apply a color palette automatically to a new terminal window, you can add 
  the following line to one of your system startup files (e.g ~/.profile,
  ~/.ashrc or ~/.bashrc):
  
      [ -x "$(command -v kfc)" ] && kfc -s PALETTE

Refer to the USAGE section for more information on command arguments.
